How do I interpret user needs and implement them into a program? How does creating “user stories” help with this?

Interpreting user needs is essential to understanding the direction of a program and the desired end functionalities of a program. By listing the user's needs and then desinging a plan around those needs you can get a better sense of how the end product should look. Creating user stories is one way of translating these needs into usable data. Writing these stories from the perspective of the end-user gives you insight into what they will be expecting when using the program and in that way allows for you to better plan out and then design the features of a program to work according to those needs.

How do I approach developing programs? What agile processes do I hope to incorporate into my future development work?

Planning, planning and more planning. Planning is essential when developing programs and incorporating the needs of the end-user and the client is important as well. I'd like to apporach developing programs by creating rough outlines of the features that are required of the program and then try to visualize the end result through writing pseducode that can allow me to bridge the gaps between the users needs and the end product. If I am working on a team of developers, emphasizing the agile process of collaboration would be essential for success, I feel. Through talking the plan over with my colleagues, we can get a better idea of what will be required from all of us during the development phase.

What does it mean to be a good team member in software development?

Being a good team member starts with being a good listener. Being able to listen to someone's needs or plan and critically think about their plan through identifying the pros and cons and the applications of their plan to the overall software development cycle, is crucial in maintaing open collaboration during development. To that end, collaboration is also key and listening is only half of that. Being able to convey your ideas concisely and with confidence will allow for the members of your development team to work with you much easier and makes the entire process more smooth.
